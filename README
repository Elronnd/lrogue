This is a modernized-ish version of lrogue, which stands for linux
rogue; it's a clone of rogue.  See rogue's wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game).

To build, type "make".  I have not tested it on windows, but it should work
there with pdcurses.

It comes originally from ftp://ftp.sun.ac.za/pub/mirrors/sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/games/dungeon/lrogue0.1.tar.Z,
and you can also get a copy at https://github.com/Elronnd/lrogue/archive/original.tar.gz.

Be advised that those are probably only useful for historical research; if you
want something to play, the mainline of this version is probably what you want.
