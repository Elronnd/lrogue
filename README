This is a modernized-ish fork of lrogue, in turn a fork of a clone of the original rogue.  I originally got this as a tarball from here: ftp://ftp.sun.ac.za/pub/mirrors/sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/games/dungeon/lrogue0.1.tar.Z  However, if that goes down, or is annoyingly slow, I have mirrored it EXACTLY at https://github.com/Elronnd/lrogue/archive/original.tar.gz  That doesn't compile easily, however, and you are encouraged to clone directly from the latest master of the github repo.  Lastly, the README that originally came with the tarball can be viewed at README.old.
