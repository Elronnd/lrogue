This is a modernized-ish fork of lrogue, in turn a fork of a clone of the original rogue.  I originally got this as a tarball from here: ftp://ftp.sun.ac.za/pub/mirrors/sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/games/dungeon/lrogue0.1.tar.Z  However, if that goes down, or is annoyingly slow, I have mirrored it at https://github.com/Elronnd/lrogue/archive/original.tar.gz  You can also get it from the internet archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20190322183021/http://ftp.sun.ac.za/ftp/pub/mirrors/sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/games/dungeon/lrogue0.1.tar.Z  That doesn't compile easily, however, and you are encouraged to clone directly from the latest master of the github repository.

To build, type "make"
